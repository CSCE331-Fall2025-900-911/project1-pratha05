            Mentored and tutored underprivileged students, offering academic support, guidance, 
            and motivation to help them overcome learning gaps. Through personalized teaching 
            and interactive sessions, I aimed to nurture their confidence, develop essential 
            life skills, and create meaningful educational experiences that empowered them to 
            grow both academically and personally.

            worked with a support foundation under the guidance of Dr. Srivastava, where I helped 
            children with disabilities develop communication skills and better engage with their 
            surroundings. By encouraging self-expression and creating inclusive interactions, I 
            supported their ability to connect with others, adapt to daily environments, and 
            discover new ways of learning.

            taught high schoolâ€“level science, math, and English to children who had little or no 
            access to formal schooling. Beyond academics, I focused on simplifying complex 
            concepts, sparking curiosity, and building a supportive learning environment that 
            encouraged students to think critically, develop problem-solving skills, and engage 
            actively with their education.
