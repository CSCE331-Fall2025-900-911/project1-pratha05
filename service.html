                            Worked with a support foundation under the guidance of Dr. Srivastava, where I helped children with disabilities develop communication skills and better engage with their surroundings. By encouraging self-expression and creating inclusive interactions, I supported their ability to connect with others, adapt to daily environments, and discover new ways of learning.

                            Taught high school-level science, math, and English to children who had little or no access to formal schooling. Beyond academics, I focused on simplifying complex concepts, sparking curiosity, and building a supportive learning environment that encouraged students to think critically, develop problem-solving skills, and engage actively with their education.
